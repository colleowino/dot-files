Hello there,

Thanks for stopping by. There is how I configured my coding environment.
Am was running ubuntu 15.10 at the time I wrote this 15.02.2016

Basic environment configuration files:
	- z-shell : .zshrc

- I use vim-gnome with gruvbox colors and [light line](https://github.com/itchyny/lightline.vim) as my status bar.
